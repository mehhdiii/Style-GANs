# Style Transfer GANs
The repository impliments style transfer GAN architecture on videos using Transfer Learning on VGG-19 architecture. 

## How to run this notebook
To run the notebook, upload it to a kaggle envoirnment and add [VGG-19](https://www.kaggle.com/keras/vgg19) and [dataset1](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdirazakhorasani/goldfincheseating), [dataset2](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/style-transfer-and-object-detection) in /input/ directory.
